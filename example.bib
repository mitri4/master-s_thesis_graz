  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Seborrheic keratosis ({SK}) is one of the most common epidermal tumors of the skin. However, only a few large-scale clinicohistopathological investigations have been conducted on {SK} or on the possible correlation between histopathological {SK} subtype and location. {OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and histopathological features of a relatively large number of cases of diagnosed {SK}. {METHODS}: Two hundred and seventy-one pathology slides of skin tissue from patients with clinically diagnosed {SK} and 206 cases of biopsy-proven {SK} were analyzed. The biopsy-proven cases of {SK} were assessed for histopathological subclassification. The demographic, clinical, and histopathological data of the patients were collected for analysis of associated factors. {RESULTS}: The most frequent histopathological subtype was the acanthotic type, followed by mixed, hyperkeratotic, melanoacanthoma, clonal, irritated, and adenoid types; an unexpectedly high percentage (9.2\%) of the melanoacanthoma variant was observed. The adenoid type was more common in sun-exposed sites than in sun-protected sites (p=0.028). Premalignant and malignant entities together represented almost one-quarter (24.2\%) of the clinicopathological mismatch cases (i.e., mismatch between the clinical and histopathological diagnoses). Regarding the location of {SK} development, the frequency of mismatch for the sun-exposed areas was significantly higher than that for sun-protected areas (p=0.043). {CONCLUSION}: The adenoid type was more common in sun-exposed sites. Biopsy sampling should be performed for lesions situated in sun-exposed areas to exclude other premalignant or malignant diseases.},
